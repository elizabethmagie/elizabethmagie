  <p>
    I am a software engineer with past professional experience in mechanical engineering. Working as an engineer has taught me to think critically and solve problems in fast-paced environments, and I am eager to join a company where I will be challenged to grow, innovate, and make a meaningful impact.

    I learned to code through courses at Cornell University and Codecademy, completing full Computer Science and Web Development tracks. Through these courses, I worked with Python, JavaScript, CSS, SQL, HTML, React, and more. As a capstone project, I built a React web application called Jammming enabling users to search the Spotify library, craft personalized playlists, and save them directly to their Spotify accounts. Check it out in my featured section below!
